👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at VIT Bhopal with a deep passion for Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and building intelligent solutions to real-world problems. I enjoy diving into complex datasets, engineering robust ML pipelines, and bringing models to life.

🔭 I’m currently contributing to the AQUANET research project, developing YOLOv8-based models for high-value object recovery in flood scenarios.

🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge of cloud technologies on AWS and exploring advanced deep learning architectures.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to data science and computer vision.

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I co-lead the technical team for my university's Music Club, managing sound engineering and event setups!

🚀 My Tech Stack
This is my toolbox for turning ideas into reality. I'm always eager to learn more.

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of.

Project Name

Description

Tech Stack

🔬 AQUANET Research

Contributed to a research paper on object detection for flood recovery under the guidance of mentors from IIT Delhi. Focused on dataset creation, literature survey, and model evaluation.



🏎️ Formula 1 Race Position Prediction

Built an end-to-end ML pipeline using FastF1 API data to predict race outcomes. Implemented feature engineering, trained an XGBoost model, and visualized key insights.



🏠 House Price Prediction

Designed and deployed a complete ML pipeline to predict house prices. Included feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and robust model selection.



👩 Skin Type Classification

Developed a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin types from facial images, using OpenCV for preprocessing and data augmentation.
